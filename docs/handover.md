# Packaging a hand-off

> Read this before copying, archiving or otherwise transferring a working tree to anyone else.

```bash
docker compose down -v && git status    # drop the volumes, confirm the tree is clean
```

**`git status` clean is not the same as safe to hand over**, and the gap is the point of this
document. Everything below is deliberately untracked — it is generated, per-machine, or secret —
so a clean tree says nothing about it, and a hand-off packaged as an archive or a copied
directory carries all of it.

| Purge | Holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| `backups/` | Full logical dumps from `scripts/backup-databases.sh` — `auth.users` bcrypt hashes, OAuth client secret hashes, every audit row |
| `.env` | All 24 generated credentials, including `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` |
| `.env.gateways` | Per-gateway broker passwords written by `npm run provision:gateways` |
| `mosquitto_certs` volume | The internal CA **private key**. Distributed to every physical gateway's trust store — re-minting it takes the fleet offline silently |
| `frontend/dist/` | A built bundle carrying whichever `VITE_*` values were baked at build time |

```bash
rm -rf backups/ .env .env.gateways frontend/dist/
npm run setup                           # regenerate .env for the recipient
```

The recipient runs `npm run setup` themselves — that is what makes the credentials theirs rather
than a copy of yours. `.env.example` carries working development secrets so the stack still starts
without it, which is a convenience and **not** a supported state for anything another person can
reach.
